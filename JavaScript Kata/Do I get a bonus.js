/* It's bonus time in the big city! The FatCats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary. */

function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
	return "Â£" + salary * (bonus ? 10 : 1);
