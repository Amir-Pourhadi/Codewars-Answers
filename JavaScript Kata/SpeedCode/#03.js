Objective
Preloaded for you is a class Dog:

class Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = species;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = size;
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = loyal;
  }
}

You are then given a working class Labrador as your initial code.
